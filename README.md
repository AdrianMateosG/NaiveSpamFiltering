# Detecting SPAM emails with a Naive Bayes Classifier
A machine learning project that implements a Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam emails. The classifier achieves strong performance metrics with:
- 98.38% Accuracy
- 96.58% Precision
- 91.56% Recall
- 94.00% F1 Score
  
The implementation includes:
- Text preprocessing (lowercase conversion, special character removal, stopword removal, stemming)
- Feature engineering using word frequencies
- Naive Bayes classification from scratch
- Model evaluation with detailed metrics
- Ability to generate synthetic spam/non-spam messages using learned probabilities

Built using Python with pandas, numpy and basic NLP techniques. The model is trained on the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle.
